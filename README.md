## Clear Target
Currently, only the Parser function is available. Parser only contains one engine, Google CSE. 

### Introduce  
Need to go https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all To obtain CES APIs Key, you can try obtaining the Key multiple times to achieve the required amount per day. This program supports reading multiple APIs.  
Clear Target supports multithreading, supports http \ socks4 \ socks5 \ proxyless proxy mode (supports IP: POST: User: PASSWORD), supports multiple proxy APIs for reading, and supports logs and CUI mode output.
